### Hi Developers! Let's Explore HarmonyOS Cloud Storage in Practice  

Today, we'll dive into practical scenarios for **HarmonyOS Cloud Storage**, guiding you step-by-step through core features like file uploads, downloads, and metadata operations. No need for dry official docsâ€”we'll master these APIs in the most straightforward way possible! (Complete code examples are attached at the end.)


### I. Cloud Storage Features at a Glance  
HarmonyOS Cloud Storage acts like a portable USB drive, securely storing app data in the cloud. Ideal for user avatars, game saves, and multimedia files. Its three key advantages:  

- **Auto-Sync**: Real-time synchronization between devices and cloud  
- **Granular Permissions**: Precise access control for each file  
- **Massive Storage**: Supports uploads up to 1GB per file  


### II. Four Steps to File Uploads  
**Prerequisites**: Ensure user is logged in via authentication service (Huawei Account recommended)  

```typescript  
// 1. Get local file path (example uses sandbox path)  
let localPath = "internal://app/files/photo.jpg";  

// 2. Create cloud storage instance  
const storage = new Storage();  

// 3. Execute upload (with progress callback)  
try {  
  const uploadResult = await storage.upload({  
    localPath: localPath,  
    cloudPath: "user_uploads/2023/photo.jpg",  
    onUploadProgress: (progress) => {  
      console.log(`Uploaded ${progress.loaded} / Total ${progress.total}`);  
    }  
  });  

  // 4. Handle results  
  console.log(`Upload successful! Actual transfer size: ${uploadResult.bytesTransferred}`);  
} catch (error) {  
  console.error("Upload failed:", error);  
}  
```  

**Pitfall Prevention**:  
- Use sandbox paths starting with `internal://app/`  
- Add permissions like `ohos.permission.READ_MEDIA` in `config.json` for access issues  
- Large files support automatic resumable uploads (max 5 retries)  


### III. File Download in Action  
Want to save cloud files locally? Try this:  

```typescript  
// Download to sandbox downloads directory  
let savePath = "internal://app/downloads/demo.jpg";  

const downloadResult = await storage.download({  
  cloudPath: "user_uploads/2023/photo.jpg",  
  localPath: savePath,  
  onDownloadProgress: (progress) => {  
    console.log(`Download progress: ${(progress.loaded/progress.total*100).toFixed(1)}%`);  
  }  
});  

console.log(`File saved to: ${savePath}`);  
```  

**Important Reminders**:  
- Download paths must be within the app sandbox  
- Verify file integrity with `getFileHash()`  
- Check local storage availability before download  


### IV. Advanced File Metadata Operations  
Cloud Storage lets you add "identity information" to files:  

**Set Metadata** (e.g., configure caching policy):  

```typescript  
await storage.setMetaData({  
  cloudPath: "user_uploads/2023/photo.jpg",  
  metaData: {  
    contentType: "image/webp",  
    cacheControl: "max-age=3600",  
    customMetadata: {  
      author: "Developer Xiaoming",  
      version: "2.0"  
    }  
  }  
});  
```  

**Get Metadata**:  

```typescript  
const fileInfo = await storage.getMetaData("user_uploads/2023/photo.jpg");  
console.log(`File type: ${fileInfo.contentType}`);  
console.log(`Custom field: ${fileInfo.customMetadata.author}`);  
```  


### V. File Deletion  
Clean up unwanted files promptly:  

```typescript  
try {  
  await storage.deleteFile("user_uploads/2023/obsolete.jpg");  
  console.log("File deleted");  
} catch (error) {  
  console.log("Deletion failed, file may not exist");  
}  
```  


### VI. Advanced Tips  
**Console Visual Operations**:  
Drag-and-drop files in the AGC Console for non-technical users  

**Security Rule Configuration**:  

```json  
// Example: Allow users to manage only their own files  
"match /users/{userId}/{file}": {  
  allow read, write: if request.auth.uid == userId;  
}  
```  

**Best Practices**:  
- Enable version control for critical files  
- Regularly purge temporary files  
- Automate file processing (e.g., thumbnail generation) with cloud functions
